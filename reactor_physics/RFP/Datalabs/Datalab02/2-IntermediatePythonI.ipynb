    "During the previous datalab we have learnt about the basic built-in features of python: we learnt about variable and data types, loops and conditions. We also mentioned before that there are thousands of open source packages which can be imported to python. Several of these libraries are considered rather standard (and preinstalled when using anaconda). If we would like to create a package executing less standard tasks (for example parsing nuclear data formats), it is worth browsing the world wide web for pre-existing solutions before reinvintenting the wheel. There is for example the nuclear engineering toolkit called Pyne which provides a lot of functionality relevant for nuclear scientists. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the next two datalabs we are going to try some standard libraries, and get acquainted with various data formats.\n",
    "\n",
    "Libraries reviewed today are:\n",
    "- numpy which provides data containers and functions to perform numerical analysis, matrix operations, linear algebra and a lot more.\n",
    "- matplotlib which provides visualization tools from simple 2D plots to advanced 3D visualizations\n",
    "- scipy which provides scientific tools, for example fitting, ODE solvers, numerical integration\n",
    "- re which allows using regular expressions. A regular expression (often called regex or regexp) is a search pattern specified as a sequence of characters. The `re` package provides regexp operations. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is neither possible nor necessary to review all the features of these packages, rather we would like to provide you with the basic terminology and to cover the basic functionality of these packages. That said, what is imporant for now is to know about these packages, familiarize yourself with the basic principles of these tools. Later, in other exercises we are going to refer to functions and methods of these libraries. It is not required to keep all functionality of these libraries in your head, as you will advance you will often find yourself googling for solutions, reading through stackoverflow entries, and then with your basic understanding and the knowledge of the terminology you will be able to adapt the proposed solutions to your own needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several other mainstream libraries of python which we will not cover at all in this course. For example symPy allows for symbolic operations, or sklearn provides an interface to machine learning models. Nevertheless, once you got a feeling for using python, it will be relatively easy for you to use any other package according to your future needs.\n",

    "## Numpy\n",
    "\n",
    "We saw before how to organize data in arrays called lists. Lists are extremely flexible, they can store data of different types (eg. `[1,'one',True]`), and one can easily create multidimensional lists, or matrices (eg. `[[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]`). Nevertheless, in some sense this flexibility is also a drawback. If we perform operations on a list (for example by looping over its elements, and performing some simple mathetmatics), Python needs to check the type of each element. For a compiled code, when the type is declared beforehand such checks are not needed, hence it runs faster. Numpy (numerical python) offers a more efficient data structure called *numpy array* (which stores elements of the same type) and provides related data operations. Numpy arrays are important building blocks of several other tools (eg. data science applications), and they make life easier, hence it is valuable to understand how to use them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Besides the numpy array, numpy contains a lot of useful functions and libraries (operations and linear algebra on the arrays, random number generators etc), which we will not cover now, but we will use them later on. \n",

    "\n",
    "We saw previously how to do some mathematics with Python, but of course as aspiring scientists or engineers we would like to present our results visually as well. Matplotlib is a multi-platform data visualization library. It is designed to work with Numpy arrays. It will allow us to create 2D and 3D plots, and we can even create simple graphics as we will see. Matplotlib works well on several operating systems and it supports several output formats.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic syntax of Matplotlib will feel familiar to Matlab users, and indeed it is straightforward to create basic plots. However, creating more difficult plots can feel sometimes frustrating.\n",
    "\n",
    "Besides Matplotlib, an other mainstream visualization library called Seaborn is also available in the Python universe. We are not going to use this in the course.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Simple 2D plot\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us first simply look at the basic features by plotting the exponential decay curve. The most simple example would look like this. "

    "In the following we will show how to customize parts of the figure. With `plt.figure` we create a canvas (and can set a size), then `plt.plot` will plot the specified X and Y arrays against each other. Here we can set the color, the type of the curve (solid or dashed etc.), the markers, and marker size or line width (`lw`), and we can add a label. If more `plt.plot` commands would be included, more curves would appear on the canvas. We can include a label, which will be shown if a legend is created (`plt.legend`)\n",
    "\n",
    "We can set the label on the x and y axis (`plt.xlabel`, `plt.ylabel`), and a title (`plt.title`). LaTeX expressions can be used where strings are given to describe content (`r'$a=3$'` will be rendered as LaTeX, `a=3` would be rendered as a normal string). With `xlim`, `ylim`, `xticks` and `yticks` we can set the boundaries of the plot and overwrite the default tick positions and labels.\n",

    "\n",
    "Note that all these commands are optional, and they have further parameters to tune. Almost anything is possible here. Don't be afraid to google, or ask ChatGPT for solutions when you want to make your plots pretty.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `matplotlib.pyplot` library has several more plotting options for scatter plots, errorbars, histograms, barplots, charts etc. You can also change the axis to logarithmic (and there are functions readily available for this which might sound familiar to previous Matlab users: `plt.loglog`, `plt.semilogx`, `plt.semilogy`. We will use some of these later in the course. "

Outside of the bracket, the + indicates one or more  occurance of the preceding element, and `\\d` indicates a digit, so `\\d+` will match one or more digits.

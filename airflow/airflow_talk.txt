# Airflow Chat Notes:

* Intro:

    - Installation on docker
    - Manjaro
    - Images being broken

* What is Airflow
    - workflow management tool
        - airbnb 2014 
        - uses:
            - training, testing and deploying ml models
            - Ingesting data from REST APIs
            - Co-ordinaiting ETL / ELT 

* Key / Unique features:

    - Easy to use and maintain
    - Open-source
    - Robust integration
    - Simple UI
    - Use of DAGs (show this in train 1)

* Most well known tools use DAGs
    - often defined as yml, or in the UI
    - Airflow uses python scripts to define DAGs

* Go over DAG file
    - DAG file breakdown
        - imports
        - default args
        - define dag
        - task dependencies
    - Show env
    - Show python & sql

* Airflow theory

    - architecture 
        - User
        - dags folder
        - airflow scheduler checks dags
        - adds to execution que
        - airflow workers
            - types of executors
        - airflow metastore
            - success, queued, executed, conditions on running
        - airflow webserver

* Go over data pipeline definition

    - what are we trying to achieve
    - xml -> postgres

# Demonstration

* $ sudo docker-compose up

* New terminal $ docker ps

* Connect to container 

* sudo docker run -p 5000:8080 --entrypoint /bin/bash -ti  apache/airflow:2.1.3

* airflow@ba984c28b22a:/opt/airflow$ airflow webserver -p 8080

* Navigate to localhost

    - UI
    - Example DAGs
    - 
    - python script
    - sql script
    - logs

* Show the airflow metastore:

    - $ sudo docker exec -it efdb129739f0 bash
    - $ psql -h localhost -p 5432 -U airflow -W
    - \d


* REAL LIFE DEBUGGING 

python3 /opt/airflow/dags/python_scripts/process_xml.py'

    - Show docker file
    - Show path in pytho script
    - Show log file error










# Setup:

# What is the problem:

* docker-compose does not build webserver or runs indefinitely

# Assumptions:

* Nothing wrong with docker file as I have run it before
* This should work across OS's

# What have I tried:

* Tried running on Mac, same result
* Trying to find out how to limit pip
* Tested that docker can runn hello-world

# Solution (What did I do):

* I downloaded the official airflow image - from the docs -> 

https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/start/docker.html

* Ran command to create .env variables

$ mkdir -p ./dags ./logs ./plugins
$ echo -e "AIRFLOW_UID=$(id -u)\nAIRFLOW_GID=0" > .env

$ docker-compose up airflow-init

* Get the container name

$ docker-ps

* Bind to webserver

$ docker run -p 5000:8080 --entrypoint /bin/bash -ti  apache/airflow

$ docker-compose up

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55892142/cant-access-webserver-of-airflow-after-run-the-container/55894168

* In a new terminal -> Navigate to domain

* Connect to container first

$ airflow webserver -p 8080

* Modified yaml file to include the /include directory for SQL

* To clean up & stop volumes

$ docker-compose down --volumes --rmi all

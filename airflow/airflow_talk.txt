# Setup:

# What is the problem:

* docker-compose does not build webserver or runs indefinitely

# Assumptions:

* Nothing wrong with docker file as I have run it before
* This should work across OS's

# What have I tried:

* Tried running on Mac, same result
* Trying to find out how to limit pip
* Tested that docker can runn hello-world

# Solution (What did I do):

* I downloaded the official airflow image - from the docs -> 

https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/start/docker.html

* Ran command to create .env variables

$ mkdir -p ./dags ./logs ./plugins
$ echo -e "AIRFLOW_UID=$(id -u)\nAIRFLOW_GID=0" > .env

$ docker-compose up airflow-init

* Get the container name

$ docker-ps

* Bind to webserver

$ docker run -p 5000:8080 --entrypoint /bin/bash -ti  apache/airflow

$ docker-compose up

* In a new terminal -> Navigate to domain

$ airflow webserver -p 8080

* Modified yaml file to include the /include directory for SQL

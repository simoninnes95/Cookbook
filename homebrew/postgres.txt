# Output from brew installation:
    
    Pouring postgresql@15--15.1_1.arm64_ventura.bottle.tar.gz
    ==> /opt/homebrew/Cellar/postgresql@15/15.1_1/bin/initdb --locale=C -E UTF-8 /opt/homebrew/var/postgresql@15
    ==> Caveats
    This formula has created a default database cluster with:
      initdb --locale=C -E UTF-8 /opt/homebrew/var/postgresql@15
    For more details, read:
      https://www.postgresql.org/docs/15/app-initdb.html

    postgresql@15 is keg-only, which means it was not symlinked into /opt/homebrew,
    because this is an alternate version of another formula.

    If you need to have postgresql@15 first in your PATH, run:
      echo 'export PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/postgresql@15/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc

    For compilers to find postgresql@15 you may need to set:
      export LDFLAGS="-L/opt/homebrew/opt/postgresql@15/lib"
      export CPPFLAGS="-I/opt/homebrew/opt/postgresql@15/include"


    To restart postgresql@15 after an upgrade:
      brew services restart postgresql@15
    Or, if you don't want/need a background service you can just run:
      /opt/homebrew/opt/postgresql@15/bin/postgres -D /opt/homebrew/var/postgresql@15

    Disable this behaviour by setting HOMEBREW_NO_INSTALL_CLEANUP.

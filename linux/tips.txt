# Check process priotities

    There are a total of 140 priorities and two distinct priority ranges 
    implemented in Linux. The first one is a nice value (niceness) which 
    ranges from -20 (highest priority value) to 19 (lowest priority value) 
    and the default is 0, this is what we will uncover in this guide. 
    The other is the real-time priority, which ranges from 1 to 99 by default, 
    then 100 to 139 are meant for user-space.
